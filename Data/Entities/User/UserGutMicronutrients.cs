Individuals who avoid animal products are also at risk of a B12 deficiency. Certain medications also contribute to vitamin B12 depletion.  A vitamin B12 deficiency can manifest as neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling in the hands, legs, and feet, difficulty walking, and confusion or difficulty thinking. Other symptoms can include anemia, weakness and fatigue, constipation, and a swollen tongue. A vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to permanent nerve and brain damage and increase the risk of dementia.")]
